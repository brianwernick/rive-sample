## Rive Sample
This project has 2 primary uses:
  1. As an example of how to use Rive in Jetpack Compose
  2. As a way to provide reproduction setups for issues filed with Rive


### Compose
The Compose implementation is split between 2 primary files located under `components`
  1. `RiveAnimation` which provides the Composable function of the same name
  2. `RiveStateController` which is used by the `RiveAnimation` to provide a more Compose friendly way of controlling animations
